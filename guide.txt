STRUCTURE OF GAME

1. load board and pieces inside of main function (no classes)

    make functions that move pieces (in another file)
    
    8x8 and if the piece is trying to move <1 or 8< not cool

    represent the board by:  

    have pieces at the starting positions

    make board easily updatable (move, take, check state, switch turn??)

//. start game white turn

2. check which piece the user wants to move => is it a valid move?
    define each square with a coordinate, current piece (a-h, 1-8)

    check where mouse down -> get square, get piece, get moves possible(for that piece, inside or outside bounds?).
    to mouse up -> expected move
    if(move good) => update board; else => reject and reset mouse or event

    

. update board
    change the states of the pieces -> taken piece, new move, check, etc
    


. check game state is there a winner? if not, continue.
